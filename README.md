Avatar Clothing Helper
======================

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that automatically sets up Blendshapes with the same name on multiple renderers to be driven by the "primary" mesh's values on import or when pressing a button on the SkinnedMeshRenderer.  
The "primary" mesh is the one with the most blendshapes on it.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [AvatarClothingHelper.dll](https://github.com/Banane9/NeosAvatarClothingHelper/releases/latest/download/AvatarClothingHelper.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
